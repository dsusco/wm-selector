The player then rolls 5d6 and adds the scores together - this is the total distance the Wagon unit ttravels before the Wagons tip over and destroyed. The Wagons will roll through any units in their wau, striking each in turn. Any unit hit by the runaway Wagons suffers 6 attacks with no saving throws allowed for any hits caused. Enemy units treat any hits suffered as missile hits in the Shooting Phase and must roll for drive backs accordingly.",

In any case, once employed in this fashion, the Ballast Wagon unit is destroyed and all three stands representing it are removed."
