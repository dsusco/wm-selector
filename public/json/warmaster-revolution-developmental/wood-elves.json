Treat the order as issued to the nominated point, and apply any modifiers for distance and proximity of enemy, but ignore penalties of dense terrain. The nominated point must lie either on the table within dense terrain or on any base edge other than the enemy player's own table edge.

Once deployed, orders can be given to the unit by the same character that gave the infiltration order if he is within his normal command range, the infiltrating unit is considered to have used its first order to deploy.
