Instead individual units can be infiltrated onto the battlefield once the game has begun. To infiltrate a unit, the Skaven player nominates the point where he wants the Gutter Runners to appear and issues an 'infiltration' order from any character. The character does not have to be within his normal command range to issue an infiltration order - the character's command range is considered to extend over the entire tabletop when issuing an infiltration order. Treat the order as issued to the nominated point, and apply any modifiers for distance and proximity of enemy, but ignore penalties for dense terrain. The nominated point must lie either on the table within dense terrain or on any base edge other than the enemy player's own table edge. If successful, place one stand on the nominated spot and arrange the rest of the unit into formation around it. The infiltrated unit cannot be placed so that it touches an enemy unit. Once deployed, orders can be given to the unit by the same character that gave the infiltration order if he is within his normal command range, the infiltrating unit is considered to have used its first order to deploy. If the infiltration order is failed the unit is not deployed and cannot infiltrate that turn, it can attempt to infiltrate in a subsequent turn at the same or a different place."

It cannot move using initiative and cannot be driven back by shooting and does not roll for drive backs. In combat it is automatically destroyed if forced to retreat but will pursue, advance and fall back so long as it is touching a Skaven infantry unit at the start and end of its move: otherwise it cannot pursue, advance or fall back as it is unable to move of its own accord. All Skaven units touching the Screaming Bell are unaffected by the usual penalty for Terror whilst they remain so.
