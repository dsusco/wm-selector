Dragon Rider units and any other units that include a Dragon riding character cause terror in their enemies.","","Because Dragon Riders have a great many hits (6) which are difficult to inflict even during a lengthy combat engagement, we must consider the possibility of hurting the Dragon and reducing its effectiveness in subsequent turns. Therefore, if a Dragon Rider has accumulated 3-5 hits by the end of the Shooting phase or Combat phase it is deemed to have been badly hurt. Once a Dragon has been badly hurt all accumulated hits are discounted and its maximum hits value and Attacks are halved for the rest of the battle (to 3 Hits and 3/2 Attacks).","","**Dragon Fire**","","Dragons can make a fiery breath. This applies both to a unit of Dragon Riders and to Dragons ridden by characters that have joined a unit of troops. Dragon fire works as follows. The fiery breath has a range of 20cm.
