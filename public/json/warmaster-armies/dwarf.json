They will never use their initiative to evade. Two or more Troll Slayer units cannot be given the same brigade order - only a single Troll Slayer unit can ever be included in a brigade. Troll Slayers cannot be driven back by shooting and never roll for drive backs. Troll Slayers must pursue or advance if victorious in combat where they are permitted to do so. Troll Slayers are unaffected by enemy that cause terror in combat - they don't suffer the -1 Attack modifier. Troll Slayers positively enjoy fighting monsters - the bigger the better in fact! Slayers add +1 Attack when fighting against a Monster stand.","","Troll Slayer units earn victory points differently to other units as follows:","","1. If a Troll Slayer unit has any stands remaining at the end of the battle then the full points value of the unit is awarded to the opposing side as victory points. It doesn't matter if the unit has 3, 2 or 1 stand remaining - if there are any stands left at all the enemy gets the full victory points.","","2. If a Troll Slayer unit is destroyed no victory points are scored by either side.","","Slayer units that have been destroyed still count towards the Dwarf army's losses for purposes of calculating withdrawal."],"order":3},"Cannon/Flame Cannon/Gyrocopter":{"text":["Full rules for Cannons, Flame Cannons and Gyrocopters are in the Artillery and Machines section of the rulebook.

If an enemy Wizard who is within 50cm of the Runesmith casts a spell the Runesmith can attempt to 'anti-magic' it. Note that it does not matter what the spell is or where it is cast, the Runesmith can 'anti-magic' it so long as the caster is with 50cm. To determine if this works roll a D6 - on the score of 4, 5 or 6 the Runesmith has succeeded and the spell doesn't work, it is dispelled by the Runesmith's defiant efforts. If he fails then the Runesmith's efforts come to nothing and the spell works as normal. A Runesmith can attempt to anti-magic any number of spells in a turn, but only one attempt can be made to anti-magic any individual spell - even if the army includes more than one Runesmith and several are in range of the enemy Wizard."],"order":5},"Anvil":{"text":["The army can only include a single Anvil and it is incorporated onto the stand of a Runesmith. If a Runesmith stand includes the Anvil, once per battle he can add +1 to his dice roll when he attempts to dispel enemy magic spells using the Dwarf anti-magic ability (see Runesmith). In addition the Runesmith can strike the Anvil during the Shooting phase of his own turn. The Anvil's plangent rune-song fills the Dwarfs with even greater resolve! Roll a D6. On the score of a 4, 5 or 6 all Dwarf units within 20cm of the Runesmith are unaffected by Terror till the start of the next Dwarf player's turn. On a roll of less than 4 there is no effect."],"order":6}}}
