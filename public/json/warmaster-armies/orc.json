They cannot be brigaded with other troops, although several Giants can be brigaded together if you so wish. If you attempt to give an order to a Giant and fail then you must take a test to see what it does. Ignore potential blunders - these are taken into account by the following rules. Roll a dice and consult the Giant Goes Wild chart. Where Giants are brigaded together roll for each separately.","","Giants have a great many hits, 8 in fact, which are almost impossible to inflict during even a fairly lengthy combat engagement. Because Giants have so many hits we must consider the possibility of hurting the Giant and reducing its effectiveness in subsequent turns. Therefore, if a Giant has accumulated 4-7 hits by the end of the Shooting phase or Combat phase it is deemed to have been badly hurt. Once a Giant is badly hurt all accumulated hits are discounted and its maximum Hits value and Attacks are halved for the rest of the battle (to 4 Hits and 4 Attacks). A Giant causes terror in its enemies.","","__Giant Goes Wild Chart__","","|||","-|-","_D6_|_On no!

If he reaches an enemy unit he will attack as normal. If he reaches a friendly unit he will walk straight through and out the other side if there is room and he has sufficient move. If he reaches a friendly unit and does not have sufficient move or enough room to walk all the way through then he halts on contact. A friendly unit that is walked through or contacted in this way instantly becomes confused for the remainder of the Command phase. Such a unit ceases to be confused at the end of the Command phase along with other confused units.","5|The Giant moves towards the nearest enemy unit that he can see as fast as he can. If he reaches the foe he will attack as normal. If friends are in the way he will walk through them causing confusion as described above.","6|The Giant gives a mighty bellow and rushes straight at the nearest enemy unit that he can see.
