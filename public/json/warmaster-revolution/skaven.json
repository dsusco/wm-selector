However, they may shoot from any edge without turning stands to face their target. In addition, Gutter Runners do not have to be deployed before the game if the player does not wish to do so. Instead individual units can be infiltrated onto the battlefield once the game has begun. To infiltrate a unit, the Skaven player nominates the point where he wants the Gutter Runners to appear and issues an ‘infiltration‘ order from any character. The character does not have to be within his normal command range to issue an infiltration order - the character‘s command range is considered to extend over the entire tabletop when issuing an infiltration order. Treat the order as issued to the nominated point, and apply any modifiers for distance and proximity of enemy, but ignore penalties for dense terrain. The nominated point must lie either on the table within dense terrain or on any base edge other than the enemy player‘s own table edge. If successful, place one stand on the nominated spot and arrange the rest of the unit into formation around it. The infiltrated unit cannot be placed so that it touches an enemy unit. Once deployed, orders can be given to the unit by the same character that gave the infiltration order. Gutter Runners are an exception to the Under the Lash rule and can be given orders from the distance over 20cm as normal. The infiltrating unit is considered to have used its first order to deploy. If the infiltration order is failed the unit is not deployed and cannot infiltrate that turn, it can attempt to infiltrate in a subsequent turn at the same or a different place. Gutter Runners don‘t suffer -1 Command penalty for Dense Terrain."

It cannot move using initiative and cannot be driven back by shooting and does not roll for drive backs. In combat it is automatically destroyed if forced to retreat but will pursue, advance and fall back so long as it is touching a Skaven infantry unit at the start and end of its move: otherwise it cannot pursue, advance or fall back as it is unable to move of its own accord.

In addition, any Skaven Hero or Warlock within 30cm of the Screaming Bell adds +1 to their Command value. Any enemy character within 30cm of the Screaming Bell deducts -1 from their Command value.
