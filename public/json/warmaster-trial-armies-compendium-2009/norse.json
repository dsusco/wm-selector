However, some Norsemen whenever they have more than the slightest drop of Mead go into a berserk frenzy, where they feel no pain and fear nothing. A bit annoying in the Mead Hall, but very useful on the battlefield.","","Such is the eagerness to get into combat that a unit of Berserkers will always use its initiative to charge an enemy if possible and can't be given orders instead. They'll never use their initiative to evade. They can't be driven back by shooting and do not roll for drive backs. If victorious in combat, they must pursue or advance where possible. Berserkers are unaffected by enemies that cause terror in combat, so they do not suffer the usual -1 Attack modifier."],"order":1},"Ulfwerener":{"text":["Unlike usual infantry troops, the Ulfwerener are based facing the short edge in the same way as cavalry. In addition they receive an additional +1 Attack modifier when they charge an enemy in the open in the same way as monsters and chariots and have an ability to pursue cavalry and chariots troop types. The Ulfwerener stands can never support or being supported at all. Because of their rather bestial nature, only characters with the Were Kin Character upgrade may join units of Ulfwerener and they cannot be brigaded with any units apart from other Ulfwerener. Ulfwerener units can not take any magic items."],"order":2},"Storm Giant":{"text":["The Norse Storm Giant is a common Giant from Orc army list with standard Giant's blunder rules described in 'Giant Goes Wild' chart.<table><caption>Giant Goes Wild Chart</caption><tr><th>D6</th><th>On no! What's he doing now!</th></tr><tr><th>1</th><td>The Giant will neither move nor fight this turn but simply stands rooted to the spot looking dopey.</td></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>Move the Giant directly towards the nearest table edge. If he moves into another unit he will attack it regardless of which side it is on. If victorious in combat the Giant will hold his ground.</td></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>The Giant picks up a rock, tree, abandoned cart, outhouse or whatever comes to hand and throws it at the closest unit - friend or foe - that he can see. The object travels 5xD6cm and, if it travels far enough to hit its target, strikes with 3 Attacks worked out in the usual way.</td></tr><tr><th>4</th><td>The Giant moves straight forward at full pace in the direction he is facing in. If he reaches an enemy unit he will attack as normal. If he reaches a friendly unit he will walk straight through and out the other side if there is room and he has sufficient move. If he reaches a friendly unit and does not have sufficient move or enough room to walk all the way through then he halts on contact. A friendly unit that is walked through or contacted in this way instantly becomes confused for the remainder of the Command phase. Such a unit ceases to be confused at the end of the Command phase along with other confused units.</td></tr><tr><th>5</th><td>The Giant moves towards the nearest enemy unit that he can see as fast as he can. If he reaches the foe he will attack as normal. If friends are in the way he will walk through them causing confusion as described above.</td></tr><tr><th>6</th><td>The Giant gives a mighty bellow and rushes straight at the nearest enemy unit that he can see. Move the Giant at double his normal full pace move. If he reaches an enemy unit, he fights by jumping up and down on the foe, furiously doubling his Attack value in the first round of combat.</td></tr></table>"],"order":3},"War Mammoth":{"text":["The Norse War Mammoth is a huge creature used by the Norsemen on the battlefield, especially against fortified opponents where its ability to swipe troops off the ramparts with its trunk is most useful.","","The Mammoth is a truly huge monster, so is based on a 6x4cm base, with the shorter edge being its front. It causes terror and may attack troops on ramparts with its trunk in the same manner as a Giant. Alternatively, it may elect to batter a wall section or gateway with its tusks in the same manner as a battering ram.","","One last option available in a siege is that if a Norse War Mammoth is in base contact with a wall section, then one Norse infantry unit may assault that wall section via the Mammoth. Climbing up ladders and ropes at the rear of the Mammoth and using boarding ramps and the like to assault the fortress walls. This is not quite as effective as assaulting from a siege tower, so the enemy being assaulted only counts as defended rather than in the open, but is much better than counting it as fortified. If a unit assaults in this manner, then the War Mammoth may not attack with its trunk or batter the walls; as such action would result in attacking your own troops or bringing a wall section down from under them, not a good idea, even for the Norse troops.","","When reduced to five or less hits at the end of Combat or Shooting phase but not destroyed, thereafter halve the War Mammoth's Attacks and Hits characteristics (to 4 Attacks and 5 Hits)."],"order":4},"Were Kin":{"text":["The Were Kin special mount option may be taken by any character in Norse army. It is not actually a mount as such, more an upgrade. A unit that is joined by the character with the Were Kin upgrade causes terror in its enemies. No terrain restriction apply for Were Kin - just treat the character as having +1 extra Attack and causing terror."],"order":5},"Horn of Resounding":{"text":["A single Shaman in a Norse army may be given the Horn of Resounding as a chariot mount upgrade. This not only gives some benefit in close combat but also allows the Shaman once per battle to summon the unit of Valkyries to aid the army in battle. The first precondition for summoning the Valkyries is that at least one stand of Norsemen must have been destroyed in a previous Combat phase. The second precondition is that there must be Norse units engaged in combat within 60cm of the Shaman. Once these preconditions are met then the Shaman may try to summon the Valkyries in the Norse Command phase instead of issuing a normal command.","","The way that this is done is that the Shaman takes a command check with a -2 modifier to his command value. If the roll is successful then the Valkyries are placed on the battlefield within 20cm of the Shaman, but not into combat. The Shaman may then attempt further orders on them; most likely this would be used to get the Valkyries into combat. The initial command roll is the only roll with the -2 modifier applied to the Shaman's command value. However, for every Norse unit that has been completely wiped out, there is a +1 positive modifier to the Shaman's command value for the purpose of summoning the Valkyries, to a maximum command value of 10. This means that the more Norsemen have already died, then the greater is the chance of the Valkyries' turning up.","","In subsequent turns the Valkyries may only be ordered by the Shaman with the Horn of Resounding. They can still move by initiative, but may only Home Back towards the Shaman with the Horn of Resounding. In addition, if the Shaman is killed, or rolls a blunder then the Valkyries disappear from the battlefield, their job being complete. Valkyries neither add to the army's break point, nor their loss through combat or through disappearing contributes to reaching the army break point for the purposes of withdrawal. Your opponent will not gain any victory points from destroying the Valkyries, or if they disappear because of a blunder by the summoning Shaman. However, killing the Shaman with the Horn of Resounding will grant the full victory points, as well as the immediate withdrawal of the Valkyries from the field of battle. So, look after that character!","","Valkyries are flyers, thus all the rules for flyers apply. Due to their rather eerie spectral nature, not to mention the method in which they enter the battle they cause terror in combat."],"order":6}},"spells":[{"roll":4,"range":"30cm","text":["*The Shaman turns the friendly unit into an illusive pack of monstrous creatures entailing the fear in a hearts of enemies.*","","This spell can only be cast on any friendly unit within range regardless of whether the Shaman can see it or not. The unit counts as causing terror for the duration of the Combat phase."],"name":"Aspect of Wulfen"},{"roll":5,"range":"30cm","text":["*A lightning shoots from the Shaman's outstretched arm burning all in its path.*","","Draw an imaginary line 30cm long from the Shaman's stand in any direction you wish. The line will pass through any intervening units but not beyond terrain that would normally stop a missile shot, e.g. over the crest of a hill, more than 2cm of woodland, and so forth.","","Each unit under the line takes three shooting attacks worked out in the usual way. Note that this spell can easily affect several units and will affect all units that fall beneath the line (including your own). Unengaged units can be driven back by a Thunder of Fo'Wor as with ordinary shooting (even including friends). Engaged units cannot be driven back by the Thunder of Fo'Wor but carry over any hits scored into the first round of combat; any hits scored count as having been struck in the combat itself."],"name":"Thunder of Fo'Wor"},{"roll":5,"text":["*The Shaman sacrifices a sacred Raven over a mystical flame. Ingesting the ash that is quickly formed, giving him visions of the near future.*","","The Norse player may re-roll a single D6 at any time during the rest of his turn, through his opponents turn or in his following turn up to the end of his next Command phase when the effect of the spell ends if the re-roll has not already been used. The result of the re-roll cannot be changed in any way or re-rolled again, for example with an Orb of Majesty, Banner of Fortune or through other means. Likewise the re- roll from this spell cannot be used to re-roll any dice that another re-roll has already been used on. Nor can the re- roll be used in the case of a blunder of a command roll, not even mystical foresight can help avert such mishaps, but it can mitigate the effects, so can be used to re-roll the dice roll on the blunder chart. For example if the Norse player rolled for a command needing a roll of a seven and rolled a five and a three, he could re-roll the dice that came up as a five, hopefully rolling a four or less making it a successful command.","","Only one Eye of the Raven spell may be in effect per turn."],"name":"Eye of the Raven"},{"roll":6,"range":"30cm","text":["*The Shaman makes a weird enchantment calling the gods to curse the enemy with bad luck and failure.*","","All enemy characters within 30cm of the spell caster that roll a double have those orders count as blunders. This works on all results, from a double one, to a double five. As a result all doubles rolled not only blunder, but as with all normal blunders, it counts as a failed order. The only exception is the enemy general, as he cannot blunder. The spell lasts until the end of enemy Command phase."],"name":"Spite of Low'Key"}]}
