They can't abide the taste of greenskin and won't touch a Goblin or an Orc unless they are seriously peckish. To represent this, an Ogre unit must charge a unit of humans (literally humans&hellip; Men, not Dwarfs, Elves, etc) if it is within 20cm at the start of the Command phase and the Ogres can reach it. This happens automatically and their commander can do nothing about it!"],"order":1},"Giant":{"text":["Giants are maddeningly dim witted creatures with a fondness for strong beer and the raw flesh of Men, Elves and even Dwarfs. Because of their turgid mental processes and weakness for drink, they must always be given a separate order. They cannot be brigaded with other troops, although several Giants can be brigaded together if you wish. If you attempt to give an order to a Giant and fail then you must make a test to see what he does. Ignore potential blunders, these are taken into account by the following rules. Roll a dice and consult the Giant Goes Wild chart. Where Giants are brigaded together roll for each separately. A Giant causes terror in its enemies.","","Giants have a great many hits, 8 in fact, which are almost impossible to inflict during even a fairly lengthy combat engagement. Because Giants have so many hits we must consider the possibility of hurting the Giant and reducing his effectiveness in subsequent turns. Therefore, if a Giant has accumulated 4-7 hits by the end of the Shooting phase or Combat phase it is deemed to have been badly hurt. Once a Giant is badly hurt, all accumulated hits are discounted and its maximum Hits value and Attacks are halved for the rest of the battle (to 4 Hits and 4 Attacks).<table><caption>Giant Goes Wild Chart</caption><tr><th>D6</th><th>On no! What's he doing now!</th></tr><tr><th>1</th><td>The Giant will neither move nor fight this turn but simply stands rooted to the spot looking dopey.</td></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>Move the Giant directly towards the nearest table edge. If he moves into another unit he will attack it regardless of which side it is on. If victorious in combat the Giant will hold his ground.</td></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>The Giant picks up a rock, tree, abandoned cart, outhouse or whatever comes to hand and throws it at the closest unit - friend or foe - that he can see. The object travels 5xD6cm and, if it travels far enough to hit its target, strikes with 3 Attacks worked out in the usual way.</td></tr><tr><th>4</th><td>The Giant moves straight forward at full pace in the direction he is facing in. If he reaches an enemy unit he will attack as normal. If he reaches a friendly unit he will walk straight through and out the other side if there is room and he has sufficient move. If he reaches a friendly unit and does not have sufficient move or enough room to walk all the way through then he halts on contact. A friendly unit that is walked through or contacted in this way instantly becomes confused for the remainder of the Command phase. Such a unit ceases to be confused at the end of the Command phase along with other confused units.</td></tr><tr><th>5</th><td>The Giant moves towards the nearest enemy unit that he can see as fast as he can. If he reaches the foe he will attack as normal. If friends are in the way he will walk through them causing confusion as described above.</td></tr><tr><th>6</th><td>The Giant gives a mighty bellow and rushes straight at the nearest enemy unit that he can see. Move the Giant at double his normal full pace move. If he reaches an enemy unit, he fights by jumping up and down on the foe, furiously doubling his Attack value in the first round of combat.</td></tr></table>"],"order":2},"Giant Eagles":{"text":["Giant Eagles can fly up to 100cm."],"order":3},"Giant Eagle":{"text":["Giant Eagles can be ridden by Druid only.
