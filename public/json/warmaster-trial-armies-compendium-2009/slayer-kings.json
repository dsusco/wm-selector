If destroyed by shooting the Slayercopter flies 1D6x5cm directly towards its nearest opponent (no matter if it could see it or not). At the moment the Slayercopter hits the unit it explodes and makes D6 attacks -1 save. If the Slayercopter flies short and ends its movement over a friendly unit it does the same. When destroyed in combat the Slayercopter also gets another D6 attacks on any one unit in base contact by Slayer player choice."

Note that it does not matter what the spell is or where it is cast, the Daemon Slayer can 'anti-magic' it so long as the caster is within 50cm. To determine if this works roll a D6 - on the score of 4, 5 or 6 the Daemon Slayer has succeeded and the spell doesn't work, it is dispelled by the Ward of Grimnir. If he fails then the Daemon Slayer's efforts come to nothing and the spell works as normal. A Daemon Slayer can attempt to anti-magic any number of spells in a turn, but only one attempt can be made to anti- magic any individual spell - even if the army includes more than one Daemon Slayer and several are in range of the enemy Wizard."
