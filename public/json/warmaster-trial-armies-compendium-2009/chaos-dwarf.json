If in Column or Row formation it may alternatively use these following rules:","","Extend a zone 15cm in front of the Blunderbuss unit. The zone is as wide as the unit's frontage. Each unit wholly or partially in that zone, both friendly and enemy, will take a number of shooting attacks equal to the number of Blunderbuss stands in column. Eg a unit of 3 stands in column will do 3 shots, while the same unit in a row will do 1 shot. While being charged Blunderbusses have the right to choose their special technique of shooting as long as chargers are in the firing zone (wholly or partially) at any point of time during their charge move and assuming no Blunderbusses stand is already engaged in close combat. Otherwise, Blunderbusses unit stands-and-shoots in standard way."],"order":1},"Hobgoblins":{"text":["Hobgoblins and Hobgoblin Wolf Riders carry an assortment of smaller ranged arms, so may only shoot up to 15cm. However, they can shoot from any edge without turning stands to face their target. Just measure the range from any stand edge, front, side or rear. Also this enables them to shoot at enemies charging them from any direction.

In addition the Earthshaker shot causes confusion in units in base contact with the victim unit on rolls of 6 on a D6 (roll for each unit). The total number of Earthshakers and Death Rockets in the army is limited in the way that only 1 piece of this kind is allowed per 1000 points."],"order":4},"Death Rocket":{"text":["The Death Rocket acts similar to a Stone Thrower except it shoots D6 times per phase and hits inflicted on the target can be still saved by the armour with -1 modifier (as for handguns). The total number of Earthshakers and Death Rockets in the army is limited to 1 piece per 1000 points.
