During the final decades of Vandal rule their cavalry were not considered the equals of those of the Byzantines—at least by the Byzantines themselves— and for this reason we have included the option to lose the shock rule and fight as ‘degenerate’ cavalry.",
    "",
    "Moorish Cavalry. These are unarmoured Moors carrying a small shield and generally armed with javelins. The Vandals and Moors were enemies for the most part—but mercenary Moors accompanied Gaiseric and it seems likely such troops would have been included by his successors when available.",
    "",
    "Moorish Skirmishers. These are Moorish infantry armed with either javelins, slings or bows.",
    "",
    "Moorish Archers. Moors armed with bows would probably fight as skirmishers—but we have included the option for archers to fight as formed units in order to give the army some variety.",

    "Bodyguard.  Regardless of the size of the army a single unit of Heavy Cavalry can be upgraded to ‘Bodyguard' or ‘Fideles’ - the household troops of the King.  Note that although ‘bodyguard’ they have been given ‘elite’ status with +1A. Note that Bodyguard cannot be dismounted.",

    "Dismounted Cavalry. Vandal Heavy cavalry can be dismounted to fight on foot. The Vandals were dangerous sea raiders and their military power was mostly vested at sea. As such many of their raids were fought as infantry—for example when Gaiseric sacked Rome (forever giving Vandals a bad name!). For this reason we have allowed for fielding the army as a raiding force including infantry. Note that if you take this option at least half the Heavy cavalry must be dismounted—the army represents a sea-borne raiding force with limited transport for horses.",
    "",
    "Degenerate Cavalry. The final battles between the Vandals and Byzantines seem to have exposed the weakness of the Vandal cavalry—the Byzantines put this down to soft living and idleness—and unfortunately they got to write the history books. We have allowed for the option of fielding all Vandal Heavy cavalry as non-shock types to represent this.  If cavalry are downgraded in this way Bodyguard Cavalry cannot be taken."
