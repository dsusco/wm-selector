    "Heavy Cavalry.  These are retainers of the Persian and Median nobility—they have armour and are armed with spears and swords. They are not as aggressive or hard-fighting as their Macedonian opponents and for that reason are not considered to be ‘shock’ but regular heavy cavalry.",
    "",
    "Colonist Cavalry. These are equipped in a similar fashion to the Heavy Cavalry but are less likely to be armoured and could include vassals such as Indians.",
    "",
    "Light Cavalry. The mass of Persian cavalry lack substantial armour and carry spears and javelins with which to harass the enemy rather than charging to close quarters.",
    "",
    "Mounted Skirmishers. These are Persians, Medes, Arachosians, Paphlagonians and other local skirmishing troops armed with javelins.",

    "Greek Hoplites. For many years Hoplites were the best close quarter fighting troops of the eastern Mediterranean region where they were widely employed as mercenaries. During Alexander’s wars they were to find their supremacy challenged by pike-armed Macedonians. They wear heavy armour of stiffened linen which was often reinforced by metal plates or scales—much like the cuirass worn by contemporary phalangites. They were well protected by bronze helmets and greaves, and carry a large round shield faced with bronze. They are armed with a long spear—often as long as ten feet— and a sword; which at this late period might be the single-edged Macedonian style kopis rather than the more traditional straight-bladed and double-edged weapon. Because Hoplites fought as mercenaries at this time, largely trusting to their own kind and sometimes distrusting their employers, Hoplites may not receive rear support from non-Hoplites—only Hoplites can rear-support other Hoplites.",
    "",
    "Persian Infantry. The Persian foot comprise a levy rather that professional soldiers and are armed with both spears and bows. They carry a large shield (to hide behind) . Bowfire is subsumed into combat value and is assumed to have effect only immediately prior to contact. The same stats may also represent Cardaces—a corps of Persian troops recruited from the lesser nobility and armed with shield and spear— an unsuccessful attempt to provide a home-grown alternative to the Hoplites.",
    "",
    "Subject Infantry. These are levies from far-flung satrapies of the Persian Empire. They are variously and irregularly armed with spears, bows and javelins. They wear no armour though some may carry shields. They are largely untrained, undisciplined and unenthusiastic—hence their status as ‘unreliable’.",

    "Skirmishers. Skirmishers equipped with javelins or slings and small shields—these could be troops from the Persian Empire or Greek mercenaries.",
    "",
    "Scythed Chariots. Chariots equipped with scythes were used to break up enemy formations—but rarely with any success! Rather than a fighting crew these chariots would have a single driver whose task was to ram straight into the enemy as fast as possible with fatal consequences for all concerned.",
    "",
    "Elephants. The Persians did not enjoy much success with their elephants which were inclined to stampede and run amok  amongst their own troops. Maybe that’s why they seem to be guarding the camp during the Gaugamela battle.",

    "Thracian Peltasts. Up to 2 units per 1000 pts of  infantry skirmishers can be upgraded to Thracian Peltasts representing more heavily armed and armoured peltasts of which the Thracians were the most noted. Thracians were armed with a heavy cutting weapon called a rhomphaia (variously described as a long-handled sword or a double-handed bill-like weapon) as well as javelins. Other peltasts carried a spear as well as javelins. These intermediate troops were capable of skirmishers and fighting at close quarters—they were to evolve into the most common type of foot-soldier over the following centuries largely replacing Hoplites.",
