    "‘Che’ Heavy Chariots are heavy, four horse wooden chariots with a crew armed with swords, spears and crossbows.",

    "Chinese Cavalry were most likely armed with spears and thick leather armour although it is conjectured that they may also have made use of the composite bow in imitation of their Hsiung-nu foes.",
    "",
    "Chinese Light Horse was an attempt by the Han to counter the threat posed by the Hsiung-nu.  Low quality horse archers they were always outclassed by their nomadic opponents.",
    "",
    "Halberdiers and Conscript halberdiers were armed with the cross-bladed ‘ji’ heavy spear, and well armoured in leather, paper, or even metal lamellar.  They were often unwilling conscripts and lacked staying power in open battle.",
    "",
    "Crossbowmen and Conscript Crossbowmen  were armed with the ‘nu’ pistol-grip crossbow, a cheap reliable weapon for a conscript army.  Like the halberdiers they supported, the crossbowmen were well armoured but brittle conscripts.",

    "Hsiung-nu (Xiongnu) Horse Archers represent tribesmen in the service of the Chinese.  They fight in dense skirmishing swarms, and use their deadly bows to great effect, often at the gallop.  They are also unreliable."
