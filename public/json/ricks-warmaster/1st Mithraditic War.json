        "Mithridates raised Pontus from an insignificant nation into a major power that threatened the power of Rome.  Many greeted him as a liberator from the Roman oppressor. He built an empire in Asia Minor and Greece as the champion of Hellenism whilst forming a solid trading alliance and dependent territories across the Black Sea and into the Mediterranean. Mithridates has the Empire Builder special rule. Before the game, roll a D6 and deduct 2 down to a minimum of 1. This indicates the number of enemy troop units affected (between 1 and 4). These units are considered to be Unreliable  until such time as one of your own ‘core’ units has been destroyed (i.e. scoring units for withdrawal). The opposing play picks which of his own units are affected—these must be units that are not normally Unreliable."
