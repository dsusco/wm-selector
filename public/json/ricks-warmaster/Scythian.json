        "King Atheios—whose name appears in various spellings—was said to be 90 years old when he confronted Philip II of Macedon and was defeated and killed in battle. Prior to this, however, he had enjoyed considerable success, extending his influence westwards and subjugating many of the settled peoples of the Black Sea region. So, we shall adopt his name for our Scythian General upgrade—though to be fair a more successful exponent of it might reasonably be said to have been King Idantirs whose constant refusal to close to fight, instead peppering his foes from a distant, thwarted the invasion of King Darius of Persia.",
        "",
        "If the Atheios upgrade is chosen then once per turn the shooting target of a cavalry unit within 20cm of the General can be driven ‘forward’ rather than ‘back’. This represents the unit using a feigned retreat to lure the enemy unit forwards. Before the drive back is thrown the Scythian player must announce that the Atheios ability is being used. Move the target unit exactly as you would for a drive back—but directly towards the nearest shooter rather than away from it—i.e. exactly 180 degrees opposite to normal. The unit that is driven forward won’t move closer to the closest enemy shooter than 1cm and if it would otherwise move closer the driven unit is automatically confused if it is not so already.  Once the unit has moved then any missile armed  Scythian units that did not shoot in the shooting phase can shoot at the unit if it is the closest target and within range as normal. The unit can then be driven back by further casualties. Note that any additional hits inflicted are not cumulative with hits already suffered."
