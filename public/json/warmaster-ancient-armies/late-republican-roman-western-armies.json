If the re-roll is failed, the Dictator's Command value drops by 1 – eg, from 9 to 8. The legions are nothing if not fickle and the popularity of the Dictator is based upon his success! The Dictator can continue to make one re-roll each turn as before, but each time he fails, his Command value drops a further 1."
