The reason for this is not that we’ve made grapeshot weak but that normal cannon fire represents not a single shot but a continuous bombardment in which dozens of balls are fired by each cannon. Grapeshot, on the other hand, represents just one hurried blast at close quarters, far more deadly than a single cannon ball which could easily sail over the enemy formation or pass between the ranks but not as deadly as a rain of well aimed cannon balls over a longer period.",

Both of these are normally ineligible targets, but in the case of bouncing cannon shots they can suffer hits as a result of fire directed nearby. Any friendly unengaged units that take hits from cannons are driven back as if taking enemy fire. Where friendly units are driven back in this way wait until all drive backs for enemy units have been completed, and then work out drive backs for friendly units. Any engaged units taking hits from cannons will carry hits forward into the combat round and hits count as having been struck during that round for purposes of working out which side wins.
